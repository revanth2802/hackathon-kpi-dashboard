# CGCian KPI Anomaly Radar - Hackathon Project Description

## Inspiration

During our daily operations at CGCian, we noticed teams were constantly firefighting issues that could have been caught earlier. Customer satisfaction dips, ticket volume spikes, and handling time increases were only discovered after they became serious problems affecting SLAs and customer experience. We realized that while companies collect tons of KPI data, most lack an early warning system that can proactively alert teams when metrics drift outside normal ranges.

The inspiration came from watching operations teams scramble to understand why customer complaints spiked last week, when the data showed unusual patterns days earlier that went unnoticed. We thought: "What if we could give every team a data scientist's eye, watching their KPIs 24/7 and alerting them the moment something looks off?"

## What it does

CGCian KPI Anomaly Radar is an intelligent dashboard that transforms reactive problem-solving into proactive issue prevention. Here's what it delivers:

**Smart Anomaly Detection**: Uses rolling baseline analysis with configurable sensitivity to automatically flag unusual patterns in key metrics like ticket volume, average handling time, and customer satisfaction scores.

**Instant Alerts**: When anomalies are detected, the system sends immediate notifications via Slack webhooks or email, ensuring the right people know about issues within minutes, not days.

**Visual Intelligence**: Interactive Plotly charts highlight anomalies with red markers, making it easy to spot patterns and correlate events across different metrics.

**Flexible Data Ingestion**: Accepts data from CSV uploads, local files, direct URLs, or can use sample data for immediate demonstration - no complex integrations required for proof-of-concept.

**Historical Tracking**: SQLite-based snapshots build a lightweight historical database, enabling trend analysis and pattern recognition over time.

**Configurable Sensitivity**: Teams can adjust the standard deviation threshold and rolling window size to fine-tune detection for their specific operational patterns.

## How we built it

**Tech Stack Selection**: We chose Streamlit for rapid prototyping, allowing us to build a functional web interface in hours rather than days. Python + Pandas provided robust data processing capabilities, while Plotly delivered interactive visualizations.

**Architecture**: 
- **Frontend**: Streamlit app with multi-page navigation (Overview, Process Automation, Customer Experience, Data Insights)
- **Analytics Engine**: Rolling statistics with configurable anomaly detection using mean + k*standard_deviation thresholds
- **Alert System**: Modular notification system supporting both Slack webhooks and SMTP email
- **Data Layer**: SQLite for local persistence, with support for multiple data sources (upload, local files, URLs)

**Development Approach**: We started with a minimal viable product focused on the Data Insights flow, then added complementary features. The app structure includes scaffolding for other focus areas (Process Automation, Customer Experience) to demonstrate scalability.

**Configuration Management**: Used Streamlit's secrets management for secure handling of API keys and SMTP credentials, with fallback to environment variables.

## Challenges we ran into

**Data Format Flexibility**: Every team tracks KPIs differently - some use different column names, date formats, or metrics entirely. We solved this with a dynamic column mapping interface that lets users remap their data structure to our expected schema.

**Alert Reliability**: Getting email and Slack notifications to work reliably across different network configurations was tricky. We implemented comprehensive error handling and clear user feedback for configuration issues.

**Anomaly Detection Tuning**: Finding the right balance between sensitivity (catching real issues) and noise (avoiding false positives) required extensive testing with sample data. We made the algorithm fully configurable so teams can tune it for their specific patterns.

**Demo Data Realism**: Creating sample data that felt realistic enough to demonstrate value while showing clear anomalies took several iterations. We ended up with a 30-day dataset that includes natural variations plus detectable anomalies.

**User Experience**: Making statistical concepts like "rolling standard deviation" accessible to non-technical users required careful UI design and helpful explanations throughout the interface.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

**End-to-End Functionality**: Built a complete working system from data ingestion to alerts in a hackathon timeframe - users can upload their CSV and get alerts within minutes.

**Production-Ready Architecture**: Despite being a prototype, we included proper error handling, configuration management, data validation, and comprehensive documentation that would support a real pilot deployment.

**Flexible Data Pipeline**: The system handles multiple data sources seamlessly, from drag-and-drop CSV uploads to URL-based data fetching, making it adaptable to different team workflows.

**Real-Time Alerting**: Successfully integrated with both Slack and email systems, proving the concept can connect to existing team communication channels.

**Visual Storytelling**: The interactive charts effectively communicate both current status and historical trends, making complex data accessible to all team members.

**Comprehensive Documentation**: Created templates for problem statements, solution overviews, implementation plans, and even demo scripts - everything needed for a successful pilot program.

## What we learned

**Simplicity Wins**: The most impactful features were often the simplest - clear KPI cards, obvious red dots for anomalies, and one-click alert buttons resonated more than complex statistical displays.

**Configuration is Critical**: Every organization has different tolerance for alerts and different operational patterns. Making the system highly configurable was essential for real-world adoption.

**Data Quality Matters**: Anomaly detection is only as good as the underlying data. We learned to build in data validation and provide clear feedback when data quality issues might affect results.

**User Context is Everything**: The same statistical anomaly might be critical for one team and routine for another. Context-aware alerting and team-specific tuning are crucial for avoiding alert fatigue.

**Integration Trumps Features**: A simple system that integrates well with existing workflows (Slack, email, CSV exports) is more valuable than a complex standalone tool.

## What's next for CGCian KPI Anomaly Radar

**Production Data Integration**: Connect directly to data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) and internal APIs to eliminate manual data uploads and enable real-time monitoring.

**Advanced ML Models**: Implement more sophisticated anomaly detection using isolation forests, LSTM networks, or seasonal decomposition for better accuracy with complex patterns.

**Automated Scheduling**: Build a lightweight scheduler that runs daily, automatically processes new data, and sends alerts without manual intervention.

**Team Customization**: Add role-based access, team-specific dashboards, and customizable alert thresholds based on department needs and escalation procedures.

**Expanded Metrics**: Beyond support KPIs, extend to sales metrics (conversion rates, pipeline velocity), system health (response times, error rates), and business metrics (revenue, user engagement).

**Collaborative Features**: Add annotation capabilities so teams can mark known events (deployments, campaigns, incidents) that explain anomalies, building institutional knowledge over time.

**Mobile Alerts**: Push notifications and mobile-optimized dashboards for on-the-go monitoring and faster response times.

**Predictive Capabilities**: Evolve from anomaly detection to trend prediction, helping teams anticipate issues before they occur.

**Enterprise Features**: SSO integration, audit logging, compliance reporting, and enterprise-grade security for company-wide deployment.

The vision is to make CGCian KPI Anomaly Radar the nervous system for operational intelligence - catching issues early, learning from patterns, and helping teams stay ahead of problems instead of chasing them.
